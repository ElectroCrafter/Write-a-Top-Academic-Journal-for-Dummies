| Over-claiming                              | Authors make strong claims not fully supported by their data.                       |
| Weak methodology                           | Poor design, model, or data collection makes the research not reliable.             |
| Inadequate statistics/reporting            | Missing tests or unclear data reporting makes the results less transparent.         |
| Poor literature framing & low contribution | Paper does not connect well with past studies, so the value looks small.            |
| Bad language & presentation                | Grammar errors, unclear writing, or poor figures make the paper hard to understand. |
